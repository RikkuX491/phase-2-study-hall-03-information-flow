 * Lecture #3 - Topic 2: Changing parent state
 *
 * You can change a Parent component's state by calling its function from a Child component,
 * as long as you passed the function as a prop from the Parent component to the Child component,
 * and as long as there is some code that would change the Parent component's state in the function.
